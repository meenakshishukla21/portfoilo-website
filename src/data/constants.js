    title: "CHESS",
    description:"This was a chess mini-game I created with my classmate for my 1st-semester end project. Since we were limited to C language in our 1st semester we have used ASCII output to display the chess pieces. The player controls a rook in the bottom left corner of the chessboard and the objective is to eliminate the 5 pawns on the other end of the board. If any one of the pawns reaches the end of the board or the rook is eliminated by the pawns, the player loses. The movement of the pawns is random for now, and it can only detect if the rook is in elimination distance. However, a good way to build upon this project would be by implementing Reinforcement Learning so that the pawns can learn from every game and improve the experience of the game.",
